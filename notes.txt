Toolchaining, SO, Assembler, Bootstraping is part of a very interesting field of computer technologies/science.
All this gives a very nice understand of underlays levels in software development and computer/OS/Apps working.

For those who want to give it a shot:

Topics to study:

1. The dynamic linker (ls.so or ld-linux.so)
2. The C runtime (crt*.o)
3. Egg and Chicken problem with Glibc and GCC 
	GCC needs crt1.o provided by GLIBC, but glibc needs GCC to be compiled
4. Toolchaining GCC or others compiling systems
5. Bootstraping
